//Applications of Recursion

//which programs which can be written using recursion can also be write using iteration

// where we use recursion

/*--Many algorithm techniques are based on recursion
    ->Dynamic programming
    -> Backtracking
    ->Divide and conquer (binary search, quick sort and merge sort)
  
--Many problems inherently recursive
    ->Towers of Hanoi
    -> Dps based intervals (DFS of concepts and Inorder , preorder and postorder traversal of trees)
