Hashing 
is mainly used to implement dictonary,where u have key value pairs.
It also used to implement sets , we have only set of keys.

Hashing provides search,insert,delete all three operations in O(1) times.

consider a search operation ,create a phone number as a key and value as a detail of a person
if phone number already exists it will override
delete a key and corresponding details.
